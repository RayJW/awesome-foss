# Awesome FOSS

This is a curated list of all the FOSS software I regularly use or follow to keep track of privacy respecting alternatives.

## Intro

In our current online world, most of our software choices are dominated by proprietary closed-source projects with the goal of locking users into their ecosystems and collecting as much user data as possible. This data can then be sold to advertisers to better target ads to certain groups. Additionally, this can create security issues because vulnerabilities are harder to find and diagnose for the community. Besides, if any of these tools were to shut down, all data and workflows revolving around them could potentially break or be lost on the next day.

This is why I created this list of FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) that you can use as a replacement for proprietary solutions.
